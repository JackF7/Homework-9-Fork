1). Structured query language (SQL) is a standard language for database creation and manipulation. 
SQL communicates with databases using queries to update data. 
A relation database is a type of database that organizes data into tables with rows and columns. 
It is called relational because it allows us to identify and access data in relation to other data in the database. 
They also include fields, which are pieces of information from a row, and keys, which uniquely identify each row. 
MySQL, which we are using in our class, is a relational database program.

4). A PDO is a PHP Data Object, which is a PHP framework/extension that provides an interface to access and interact with databases.
PDOs can use prepared statements, which are pre-compiled (by the database) SQL statements. 
They use placeholder values to separate the code from the data,which protects from hackers injecting malicious SQL code into queries.
Prepared statements are also efficient and easily readable.
